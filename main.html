	<h1>Time, Space and Complexity</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a way to measure how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. It helps us analyze whether a solution is efficient or not when dealing with large amounts of data. For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(1) is usually more efficient than one with O(nÂ²) because it takes less time to execute as input size grows. Understanding time complexity allows developers to compare different approaches and select the one that performs best.
	</p>
	<p><b>Space Complexity:</b>
		Space Complexity, on the other hand, focuses on how much memory an algorithm uses while executing. For instance, if an algorithm stores all input elements in an additional data structure, its space complexity may be O(n), meaning the memory usage grows linearly with the input size. This measure is crucial when working with memory-limited environments, as an algorithm with lower space complexity can be more practical even if it has a slightly higher time complexity.
